                <h3>Guitar</h3>
                <p>The guitar, a staple in music across the globe, is an instrument that captivates the
                    hearts of many with its melodic and harmonic capabilities. This article explores the
                    fascinating world of guitars, their types, structure, and the art of playing them.

                <h3>Drum pad</h3>
                <p>A control device used as an alternative to a keyboard,
                    mainly for playing drum and percussion sounds. A drum pad is intended to be struck
                    or tapped, with either drum sticks or the fingers. It generates a trigger signal
                    which usually triggers an envelope generator to play a sound with a fixed envelope
                    profile.

                <h3>Piano</h3>
                <p>The piano is a keyboard instrument that produces sound when its keys are depressed,
                    through engagement of an action whose hammers strike strings. Most pianos have a
                    row of 88 black and white keys, representing each note of the chromatic scale as
                    they repeat throughout the keyboard's span of seven and a quarter octaves.</p>
