# Lab_CPAN134
 On this lab i have try some new deisgn with linear gradient, I used a modern typography which i think would fit the vibe of the website. I went a little bit a head with this lab, i was trying to replicate hover-effect that show the content of the cards just like netflix does, but it's seems so hard and i ended up with much simpler effect which is on-click and pop-up effect. And then to make the website more responsive to other devices, I used media query just as taught in the class, min-width: 600px for smart phones and 900px is for tablet. 
 It's pretty fun to create a music website since, I've learned a lot by doing this lab. I would love to keep going on develop this website to make it better, in the future.
